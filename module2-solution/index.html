                <p>The British Shorthair is the pedigreed version of the traditional British domestic cat, with a distinctively stocky body, thick coat, and broad face. The most familiar colour variant is the 'British Blue', with a solid grey-blue coat, pineapple eyes, and a medium-sized tail.</p>

                <h2 class="section-title">Persian</h2>
                <p>The Persian cat, also known as the Persian longhair, is a long-haired breed of cat characterised by a round face and short muzzle. The first documented ancestors of Persian cats might have been imported into Italy from Khorasan as early as around 1620, however, this has not been proven.</p>

                <h2 class="section-title">Scottish Fold</h2>
                <p>The Scottish Fold is a breed of domestic cat with a natural dominant gene mutation that affects cartilage throughout the body, causing the ears to 'Fold', bending forward and down towards the front of the head, which gives the cat what is often described as an 'owl-like' appearance.</p>
